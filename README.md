# Python Skeleton for Latency Challenge

This repository contains a skeleton for submitting and scoring submissions for the tech challenge. By default, it will run as a Jupyter environment. Of course you don't *have* to submit in this manner and you can also simply use this skeleton as a base for your own implementation.

Follow the steps in this README to get a working submission.

### Requirements

- macOS or Linux terminal
- Python 3.9

### 1. Setup the Python environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add the data sets to the [/data](/data) folder

### 3. Start up JupyterLab

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then open [JupyterLab](http://localhost:8888/lab), select the `Python 3 (ipykernel)` kernel and navigate to `skeleton.ipynb`.
